#### Introduction
The "Cybersecurity Compliance Cognitive Twin" (CCCT) leverages a knowledge graph architecture to address the complexities of adhering to cybersecurity regulations, particularly the NIS 2 Directive. This twin serves as an intelligent, modular framework for managing compliance requirements, integrating domain knowledge, validation mechanisms, and automated reasoning.

#### Core Features

1. **Vocabulary Reuse from NIS2Onto**:
   - The knowledge graph utilizes the NIS2Onto ontology, ensuring semantic consistency with the NIS 2 Directive.
   - Compliance measures are specialized properties of NIS2Onto, directly referencing articles of the NIS 2 Directive.
   - Additional references to national legislation and contractual obligations are seamlessly incorporated, enriching the graph's contextual adaptability.

2. **Compliance Measures as Specialized Properties**:
   - Each compliance measure is modeled as a specialized property of NIS2Onto, carrying explicit references to:
     - Relevant articles of NIS2.
     - National legislation or other authoritative sources.
     - Related gUFO relators, representing services required to fulfill compliance, e.g., contracts with third-party providers.

3. **SHACL-Based Validation**:
   - SHACL constructs represent requirements as property shapes, encapsulating constraints and expectations for compliance measures.
   - Named SHACL property shapes enhance modularity and support reusability across various compliance contexts.
   - These constructs enable:
     - Clear specification of compliance requirements.
     - Validation of instantiated knowledge graph entities.

4. **Modularity, Maintenance, and Reusability**:
   - The use of named SHACL property shapes streamlines post-processing and maintenance.
   - Modular design ensures adaptability to evolving legislative requirements.
   - This approach facilitates the integration of additional ontologies and compliance frameworks without disrupting the core structure.

5. **SPARQL Querying and Inferencing**:
   - The graph's construction supports efficient SPARQL querying, enabling:
     - Analysis of compliance status.
     - Identification of gaps or non-compliant entities.
   - Ontological inferencing capabilities enrich the graph by deriving implicit knowledge, improving decision-making.

6. **Alignment with gUFO**:
   - Leveraging gUFO relators provides a robust mechanism for representing contracts and services linked to compliance requirements.
   - This alignment enhances traceability and accountability within the compliance framework.

#### Benefits
- **Streamlined Compliance Management**:
  The CCCT simplifies adherence to complex regulatory landscapes through automated reasoning, validation, and querying.

- **Interoperability**:
  By reusing established vocabularies and adopting modular SHACL constructs, the framework ensures compatibility with existing systems and standards.

- **Scalability**:
  The modular design supports the incorporation of additional domains, regulations, and ontological components.

- **Enhanced Validation and Decision Support**:
  SHACL-based validation and SPARQL inferencing empower stakeholders to proactively manage compliance efforts.

#### Conclusion
The Cybersecurity Compliance Cognitive Twin offers an advanced, ontology-driven solution for managing regulatory adherence in cybersecurity. By combining NIS2Onto-based vocabulary reuse, SHACL validation, modular design, and automated reasoning, it enables efficient, scalable, and reliable compliance management.
