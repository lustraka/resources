Modern heuristic endeavors to understand the process of solving problems, especially the mental operations typically useful in this process. It has various sources of information none of which should be neglected. A serious study of heuristic should take into account both the logical and the psychological background, it should not neglect what such older writers as Pappus, Descartes, Leibnitz, and Bolzano have to say about the subject, but it should least neglect unbiased experience. Experience in solving problems and experience in watching other people solving problems must be the basis on which heuristic is built. In this study, we should not neglect any sort of problem, and should find out common features in the way of handling all sorts of problems; we should aim at general features, independent of the subject matter of the problem. The study of heuristic has “practical” aims; a better understanding of the mental operations typically useful in solving problems could exert some good influence on teaching, especially on the teaching of mathematics.
